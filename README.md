# Shopping Cart
 A limited shopping cart app made to test our Stripe functionality with React in order to integrate it into a bigger project down the line. The project was built using React JS and the Stripe API.
A youtube demonstration of the app running can be seen at the following link: https://youtu.be/bCehWLRe5RA
